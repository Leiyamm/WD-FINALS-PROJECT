        <p>This is Leiyamm, welcoming you to my personal website. With this website, I aim to display what I've been able to accomplish within one semester under the "Web Design with Client-Side Scripting" course. This was all made possible with the guidance of Prof. Ian Ramirez, who I am most thankful to. Feel free to browse and discover who I am along with a portfolio of my past works.</p>

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>This project was assigned as our final submission to our professor, Sir Ian Ramirez. With some similarity to our midterm submission, this website one-ups the previous activity as it showcases the works we've done under the "Web Design with Client-Side Scripting" course. On top of that, this website features an "About Me" page (styled similarly to a resume), a "Contact" page, a showcase of all my previous projects, and a photo gallery containing photos of me, the developer.</p>

                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>To further enhance my skills as an IT student by practicing different programming languages, conceptualizing features in game development, and observing my seniors' work and taking inspiration from such. To develop not only websites but also connections with fellow developers, building a network of people that are in my field of study, spearheading projects that I can say I'm proud of 50 years from now.</p>
